# CET-4805-Arcade-Game
NYC College of Technology CET 4805 Final Project
 This system incorporates a timer using the 50MHz internal clock of the FPGA DE0 board as well as a timer and a 7 segment decoder circuit and a Finite State Machine. 
 With these systems, an Arcade game machine is built that will flash an LED green when a button is pushed during a specified state within the code. 
 if the button is pushed during the incorrect state, a red LED will turn on. A reset switch is also used to reset the LEDs and for the user to try again. 
 At this current point in time, they specified states are fixed, but this can be made random with various tweaks.
